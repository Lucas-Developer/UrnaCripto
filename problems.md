1. Votes are visible during the election. That opens doors to a few attacks. Solution: encrypt the vote declarations and only decrypt after the election is over.

2. Selling votes is not only possible but easy. There is no solution to this I can think of.

3. The receipt must be shown **before** sending it to the server, otherwise the user might vote without having his receipt.
